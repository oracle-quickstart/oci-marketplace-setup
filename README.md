# oci-marketplace-setup

The [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Quick Start](https://github.com/oracle-quickstart?q=oci-quickstart) organization is a collection of examples that allow Oracle Cloud Infrastructure users to get a quick start deploying advanced infrastructure on OCI.

This oci-marketplace-setup repo contains a template to create Marketplace publisher policies and groups in [OCI Resource Manager](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Concepts/resourcemanager.htm). You can create a Stack (copy of this template) and run an Apply job (to create the resources) by clicking the button below and following the steps in the [Deploy](#deploy) section below.

2. Variables - you can leave the defaults or uncheck any resources you do not wish to create.
3. Review - Check "Run Apply" to automatically create resources and click 'Next'
